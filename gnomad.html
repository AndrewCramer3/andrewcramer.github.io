						<h3>About the Game</h3>
						<p>Wander the twisting reaches of this whimsical fairytale world overflowing with bouncing combat, outlandish characters, and more loot than you can carry! 
							Gnomad is a 2D MetriodVania made in Unity (v.2021), with inspirations from Hollow Knight, Celeste, etc, with a focus on aerial combat and exploration.

								<h3>My Role / Contributions</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Created a comprehensive game design document to ensure total transparency about our systems and gameplay features.</li>
									<li>Used OOP principles, Design Pattern techniques and focused on modularity to make expandable and maintainable code for NPC’s and the Player. Also used and created a State Machine for NPC’s and Player scripts to better debug systems and to make the code more maintainable.</li>
									<li>Created a Room Manager System to help with loading and unloading scenes asynchronously.</li>
									<li>Designed and thoroughly tested levels within the game to ensure that our levels were entertaining and engaging.</li>
									<li>Went through preproduction for our game to understand key ideas and focuses that we wanted to have.</li>
									<li>Was tasked with music production for the game</li>

								<h3>What I've Learned</h3>
								I've learned about design patterns, and how to use them to create more modular enemy objects. This was very helpful for creating many different enemies with different behaviors.
								When creating systems for a longer-ish project, I realized overtime how necessary it was to test and debug systems quickly. Looking at different systems and seeing the pros and cons of its implementation and how it will affect future development is one thing that I've taken away from this project. 
								The C# language was something else that I learned. The C# language was somthing that I used before, but never went in depth with it. But learning it now
								and how to use interfaces and many other things to your advantage and learning to leverage those things in ways that you didn't think of before helped open my programming brain to see how to problem solve differently when creating big systems that are key to many things in your program.

									Music
								</h3>

								My main priority was programming, so there isn't much music. But I did learn piano for this project and tried to create some pieces that might fit the atmosphere. This was
								also my first time messing around in a DAW. The music is made with the BBC Symphony Orchestra VST.
